# Cluedo

Cluedo is a rush of initiation to logic programming.
<br/>This rush aims to introduce you to logic programming with Prolog.
<br/>Logic programming is a declarative programming style: the program describesfacts and rules, and leaves the proper resolution of the problem to the interpreter.
<br/>It is a project you have to do with 2people, I did it togheter with [@eutienne](https://github.com/Eutienne)
