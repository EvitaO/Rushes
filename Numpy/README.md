# Numpy

Numpy is a rush to introduce Numerical Python (NumPy).
<br/>NumPy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices,
<br/>along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.
<br/>It is a project you have to do with 2people, I did it togheter with [@eutienne](https://github.com/Eutienne)
